## Long term to do list

- Add more backends. Priorities: Acxiom, Foursquare, Superpages
- Create an agent to manage results
  - First time a search is called, agent will load most recent. Every time search is run, the agent will store the most recent collection and save it to the repo.
  - Should it load on restart?
    - Probably not. Wouldn't scale well and it's true usefulness is as a cache for often requested results.
- Enhance side menu summary for backends
  - Use an icon to indicate overall accuracy for each backend (st: develop a rating system)
- Handle a lot of results (i.e. more than 10)
  - Use limit option to determine. Let the user set the limit
- Add tests for:
  - Model: user (requires: user authentication), results
  - Controller: results_controller
  - Channel: search_channel, backend_sys, project_channel
- Update tests for:
  - Model: search (needs user to be logged in)
- Find a new name
- Refactor backends to avoid n+1
  - Bing is a big violator

## Changelog

### v0.4.2

### v0.4.1
- Bug fixes
  - Fixed issue where export results button would display when no collections were loaded.
  - Fixed issue where no results would crash BackendSys
  - Fixed issue where Supervisor terminates if a backend is missing from the Repo. Backends are loaded from the Repo now.

  - project :index no longer displays "Results" option if no searches exist for a given project. Replaced with "Add Searches" button, which links to project :show where the user can add searches to the project.

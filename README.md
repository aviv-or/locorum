# Locorum

Check local listings and assess accuracy.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## To do list

- Find way around White Pages issue. Change up headers?
- Determine how to cleanup processes if needed. Can they self-kill?
- Add more backends (Priorities: [Google, Bing, Facebook, yp.com, Citysearch, Yelp, MapQuest, Foursquare, Superpages])
- Add some sort of loading notification for each backend to the frontend.
-

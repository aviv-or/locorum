## v0.4.4 to do list
- Create a GenServer for each project channel to store ResultsCollections and interact with Repo
  - Locorum.Project.ProjectChannelServer
    - ADD: get_new_results - runs BackendSys, collects results, stores them in :ets, broadcasts to channel. NOTE!!! Updating "newest_collections" with ONLY the new results if single search conducted. Don't overwrite collections from searches that have not been re-run.
  - Locorum.ProjectChannel
    - DEL: no longer interacts with BackendSys
  - project.js
    - ADJ: Sends user_id with request for new_searches. The backends will send results to channel with user_id. Backends that match the user_id will immediately clear and list updated result. Other backends will track that a particular search has new results able to fetch.
- Handle frontend search results better
  - FIX: report back when one of the backends is down

## v0.4.5 to do list
- Redo JavaScript for project.js in React JS and Redux
  -  Need that to reload when state changes, otherwise the export results option won't work properly. Right now, it will only work after a reload and won't capture any new searches.
  - Can still keep HTML throughout the app, but the `results/index` should just contain the React app container.
  - This may affect `Locorum.BackendSys.Helpers`, which broadcasts to the channel.
    - No longer needs to prep results? Just know that it changes, then updates state, which will incorporate changes? Not sure.
  - Can't use old Project javascript with React, since the old one manipulates the DOM. React doesn't like that.
- Added :httpoison to `application` in `mix.exs`
  - Can we eliminate all the HTTPoison.start calls now?
- Allow ignore/filtering features
  - ADD: Ignore individual searches for future results
  - ADD: Customizable filters results displayed (i.e. don't display non-matching city), but still persist all results
    - IDEA: Click on any item (city, state, zip) on the main address to "lock" those results. Clicking on "city" would then only display results where city matches and set the other persisted data to ignore.
  - ADD: Suggest checking out something ignored (i.e. only city doesn't match, hey "check this out" section)
- Persist blank results
  - ADD: Persist blank results in order to display properly
  - ADD: Include blank results for each backend on export
- Errata
  - Fix 'view results in new tab' on backend results
    - ERR: Links to the first result as opposed to the results of the get_url
    - FIX: Use the get_url link, not the results first link
  - Fix CSV export
    - ERR: throws a 'Server internal error' when trying to export right after executing a new search
    - FIX: Looking for specific results?
    - FIX: Don't show export button until searches all loaded.
    - FIX: Display error when a backend doesn't respond so that the client is waiting on results that aren't going to show up.
  - Fix link to results in new tab when no results
    - FIX: throws a where: p.id == ^"undefined"

## v0.5 to do list
- When a backend doesn't work, let the user know that it timed out
- Fix supervision
  - ERR: some backends work sometimes, other times they don't
  - FIX: Better supervision and restart
- Fix backend issues:
  - ERR: Local not working
  - ERR: White Pages not working
  - ERR: YP throws an error when no results

## v0.6 to do list
- Delete deprecated files
  - DEL: results.js
  - DEL: SearchChannel
  - DEL: search :index, :show
  - DEL: results :show
- Improve CSV upload, reduce dependency on CSV formatting
  - ADJ: add error management (React? JS?)
  - ADJ: read files into an object, pull data from that object
- Setup admin, manage:
  - Users
  - Backends
    - Allow admin to disable some backends
      - Implement show.html to Handle
      - Migrate add "up" boolean, default to true
  - All projects
- Allow user to ignore individual results so they won't show up in results again
- DRY refactor
  - phonify in SearchController
  - get_refer in numerous (i.e., ResultCollectionController)
- Add documentation
  - project.js especially
  - Modules (backends not necessary)
- Testing
  - Add unit testing for Project, Result, ResultCollection, User
  - Backends

## v0.7 to do list
- Add chat capabilities
  - By search/results
  - Link to #slack
- Error check CSV upload
- Errata
  - project.js, changing href for link to results does not update DOM

## v1.0 to do list
- Check redirects after deletes
  - Maybe AJAX to create objects? Prevents "cancel" from returning to new or edit page

## Long term to do list
- Replace geocode from Google to pull from a CSV with data
  - Use an Agent that loads when the app loads
  - How do we make it available to all of the backends? Assign it to the scoket? :geocode_pid?
- Add more backends. Priorities: Acxiom, Foursquare, Superpages
- Create an agent to manage results
  - First time a search is called, agent will load most recent. Every time search is run, the agent will store the most recent collection and save it to the repo.
  - Should it load on restart?
    - Probably not. Wouldn't scale well and it's true usefulness is as a cache for often requested results.
- Enhance side menu summary for backends
  - Use an icon to indicate overall accuracy for each backend (st: develop a rating system)
- Handle a lot of results (i.e. more than 10)
  - Use limit option to determine. Let the user set the limit
- Add tests for:
  - Model: user (requires: user authentication), results
  - Controller: results_controller
  - Channel: search_channel, backend_sys, project_channel
- Update tests for:
  - Model: search (needs user to be logged in)
- Find a new name
- Use "name" instead of "biz" for search
- Refactor backends to avoid n+1
  - Bing is a big violator
- Create better overview for each search
- Implement ZipLocate Agent.

## Changelog

### v0.4.4
- Create a GenServer for each project channel to store ResultsCollections and interact with Repo
  - Created Locorum.Project.ProjectChannelSupervisor, which supervises the ProjectChannelServer
  - Created Locorum.Project.ProjectChannelServer, which holds state for all of the results for a given project and serves them to the channel.
    - ADD: init_state - returns %{collections: collections, collection_list: collection_list, backends: backends} for a given project_id
    - ADD: get_updated_results - fetches most recent result_collections for all searches
    - ADD: get_updated_result - fetches most recent result_collection for a given search
    - ADD: get_collection(collection_id) - fetches a given result_collection
    - ADD: uses :ets (Erlang Term Storage) to store all ResultsCollections for a given Project
    - ADJ: BackendSys.Helpers -> no longer broadcasts directly to the channel. Instead, it will store results in Repo and then send as a message back to the server.
  - ADJ: Locorum.ProjectChannel
    - DEL: No longer pulls data from the Repo
      - ADD: Asks for most recent ResultsCollections from ProjectChannelServer and returns that to joining call. This should allow for minimum amount of refactoring.
  - ADJ: Locorum.BackendSys
    - ADJ: Reconfigured supervision tree. Separate supervisors for BackendSys and Backends.
- Geocode
  - DEL: Google returns lat long
  - ADD: Use Locorum.ZipLocate.get_data(zip) to access csv file on server side. This is a temporary fix. In order to reduce call time, will eventually make this an Agent task that can be accessed by clients.
- Add React JS and Redux, Sass to the stack
  - Bootstrap style is still included
  - Original ES6 still works
- Added :httpoison to `application` in `mix.exs`

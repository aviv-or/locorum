# Locorum

Check local listings and assess accuracy.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## To do list

- Find way around White Pages issue. Change up headers?
- Determine how to cleanup processes if needed. Can they self-kill?
- Add more backends. Priorities: Google, Bing, Facebook, yp.com, Citysearch, Yelp, MapQuest, Foursquare, Superpages
- Add some sort of loading notification for each backend to the frontend.
- Enhance side menu summary for backends
  - Stay yellow until loaded
  - Link to respective backends using #backend
  - Use an icon to indicate overall accuracy for each backend (st: develop a rating system)
- Persist results of each search. Let the user revisit them without running the search. Compare progress.
- Handle a lot of results (i.e. more than 10). Make user go to the page?
  * Use limit option to determine. Let the user set the limit.
- Clean up passed info/supervision trees
- Add user authentication.
